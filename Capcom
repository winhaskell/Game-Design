Capcom began in Japan in 1979 as a manufacturer and distributor of electronic game machines. 
In 1983 Capcom Co., Ltd was founded and soon built a reputation for introducing cutting-edge 
technology and software to the video game market. Now an industry leader in the video game 
industry for 25 years, Capcom's legacy of historic franchises in home and arcade gaming are 
testaments to an unparalleled commitment to excellence. 

Building on its origins as a game machine manufacturer, Capcom is now involved in all areas of 
the video game industry and has offices in Tokyo, Osaka, California, England, Germany and Hong Kong.
