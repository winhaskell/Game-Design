Project
Using Common-Sense Reasoning in Video Game Design

When computers automatically generate video game environments, the result is often as simplistic as a randomly generated maze. 
Using the Open Mind Common Sense knowledge base, we are exploring ways to automatically generate virtual environments that are
immersive and intelligently designed. By allowing video games to dynamically create their own environments, developers will be
able to reduce the time they currently spend crafting environments by hand and focus on higher-level design issues. More importantly, 
games that are capable of changing their own environments will feel less static, resulting in a more believable experience and an increased replay value.
